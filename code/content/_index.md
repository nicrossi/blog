Adept at working in large, agile teams, I am passionate about harnessing technology to solve complex problems.
My expertise lies in backend design, honed over three years of hands-on experience with cloud solutions on AWS that made me an enthusiast of the cloud computing world.

But hey, life isn't all code and clouds! I'm also big on improving how I connect with people, so I'm always working on my communication skills.
I also enjoy hitting the slopes for some snowboarding in winter, and why not kick back with cold local craft beers with friends whenever we can? Cheers!
