I've never blogged about anything before, so this is a totally new skill for me to master.
But like many other proud nerds, I usually find myself jumping from blog to blog, reading about various topics.<br>
Technology is changing our lives every day, so I thought I'd share a little bit of my journey with it.
With all that said, let's see what happens from here üöÄ

## About this site
This project originated as an opportunity to experiment with the Hugo framework while also serving as a place
to document my learnings throughout my software engineering journey.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) stands as a markdown, folder-based static site generator crafted to empower creators with
effortless website development. It's open-source, has a ton of themes to choose from, and it's super fast too.
After peaking through the themes available, I decided to go with [Doks](https://getdoks.org/). It looked very complete
so I figured it would be a good starting point to learn and build upon.

## Pipeline and Automation
Like any other good engineer, I try to aim for simplicity when it comes to maintaining things, and being AWS my
bread & butter at work, I decided to host, serve, and deploy the site using AWS.
But hey! who wants to spend all their time surfing the console just to make a tweak here and there, right?
So, I went with the best practice and managed all resources using Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Keeps things nice and tidy üòå.

To streamline deployment and keep everything easily updated, I build all into a pipeline that
automates the deployment process. Hooked up to AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild, the process is triggered
by changes to the {{< hl go >}}main{{< /hl >}} branch of the site repository.<br>
<br>

Instead of going with the usual static website hosting setup on S3, I decided to go for something a bit "fancier".
I've opted for a CloudFront distribution, and it's linked to an S3 bucket acting as the origin.
And here's the cool part - using Origin Access Control (OAC) to tighten up security there's no need to make
the bucket public.<br><br>

I might write more about the full detailed recipe for building a personal site in the future,
but for now, this is it.
