A sophisticated AI-powered Sokoban puzzle solver implementing a plugin-based search
architecture with five different pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, IDDFS, A*, Greedy).
Features intelligent deadlock detection to prune impossible states and a visual
animation system for step-by-step solution playback.

*Built for the Artificial Intelligence Systems course at Buenos Aires Institute of Technology (ITBA).*

**Key Features:** Multi-algorithm search engine • Heuristic optimization • Deadlock pruning • Performance metrics • Animation export

**Algorithms:** BFS • DFS • IDDFS • A* • Local Greedy

**Heuristics:** Manhattan Distance • Sum of Distances • Perfect Matching (Hungarian Algorithm)
