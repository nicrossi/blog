A distributed emergency room management system built on gRPC microservices,
featuring a priority-based patient scheduling algorithm. The system coordinates
doctors, patients, and treatment rooms in real-time using Protocol Buffers for
type-safe communication and a multi-lock concurrency model to handle simultaneous requests safely.

*Built for the Distributed object-oriented programming course at Buenos Aires Institute of Technology (ITBA).*
